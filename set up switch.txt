This is for cisco switch

//need console cable and flash drive

first we will connect switch with pc and do backup
	plug the cable
	go to device manager
	go to ports
	get the COM number (in serial cable usually COM7)
	open terminal emulator (putty)
	go to serial tab
	change serial line to COM number
	go to session and select serial
	click open

Now start typing network commands (:

	now we will enter privllige mode and insert the flash to copy the conf.bin file of the switch (backup copy)
	2# copy usbflash0:cat9k_iosxe.17.03.03.SPA.bin flash: 
	(flash0 is the port for flash, cat9....bin is the version for the company, flash: is where to copy the file)

Now save the changes
	2#copy "file_path" running-config (file path like usbflash0:/settings.txt) (copy stored in ram only)
	2#startup-config (store in nvram)

1.setup the switch
	2# hostname "name"
	2/3#ip address "ipv4" "mask" (if switch is 3 layer you can add ip)
	if you add ip to switch you can check it in putty instead of serial use SSH and enter the ip
	
In the end you can sheck your work by using show command
	2#show run || 3# do show run
